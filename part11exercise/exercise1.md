In the case of `Python`, `flake8` or `pylint` are possible linting tools. Testing includes build in `unittest` module or `pytest`. Building include `setuptools`. Alternatives to setup CI besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions include Travis and CircleCI. As for the setup whether to be in a self hosted or cloud based environment depend on the size of the project whether the resources needed to test involves a lot of resources or special resources is GPU, if so, a self hosted solution is preferred else we use a cloud based solution especially if it is a small scale project.
